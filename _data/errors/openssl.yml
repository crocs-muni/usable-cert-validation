  weight: 102
  message: |
    certificate has expired
  new-docs: |
    The certificate has expired (its validity period passed).
    
    #### Explanation
    
    Every certificate is issued for a specific time period (determined by `notBefore` and `notAfter` fields in the certificate). The current time seems to be past the `notAfter` value. Therefore, the certificate is no longer valid.
    
    #### Security perspective
    
    The certificate is not valid anymore. That means the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) does guarantee the information in it is still correct. Moreover, expired certificates are removed from Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). That means the certificate might have been revoked in the past (e.g., because of a leaked private key), but we cannot check anymore. Thus, the server presenting this certificate may not be who it claims.
    
    #### Next steps
    
    First, ensure that the date, time and time zone are set correctly on your device to eliminate the possibility of local misconfiguration. If the time settings are correct, you should get a new valid certificate from the CA.

  message: |
    self signed certificate
  new-docs: |
    The provided certificate is self-signed and it is not present in the list of trusted certificates.
    
    #### Explanation
    
    The provided certificate is self-signed (the `issuer` and `subject` fields are the same). Self-signed certificates usually serve as the root of trust in certificate chains belonging to the Certificate Authorities (CA). However, this certificate is at "zero depth," i.e., it does not form a certificate chain. Neither is it present in the list of explicitly trusted CAs in your system.
    
    #### Security perspective
    
    Anyone can issue a self-signed certificate. Thus, the information contained in the certificate is not reliable. Therefore, the server presenting this certificate may not be who it claims.
    
    #### Next steps
    
    Try to find out if the self-signed certificate was expected at this place. Try to get a proper CA-signed certificated as self-signed certificates are not recommended even for testing purposes. If you are _absolutely certain_ this is the certificate issued by a trustworthy party, you can mark it as trusted by your system.
    The provided certificate is self-signed and it cannot be found in the list of trusted certificates.

  message: |
    Hostname mismatch
  new-docs: |
    The requested hostname does not match the subject name in the certificate.
    
    #### Explanation
    
    Information about the certificate's subject (an entity associated with the certificate's public key) is held in the `subjectAltName` extension or the `subject` field. However, the hostname of the server you are connecting to does not match the subject information in the certificate.
    
    #### Security perspective
    
    You cannot verify the identity of the server to which you are connecting – you should not proceed. The server is either providing a wrong certificate (by being misconfigured) or is deliberately pretending to be a different entity to fool you. Sending or receiving data from unknown servers may put your systems at risk.
    
    #### Next steps
    
    Compare the server hostname with the `subjectAltName` extension and the `subject` field of the certificate. Common misconfigurations include not including server aliases in the certificate (e.g., `www.example.com` for the server `example.com`).

  message: |
    unsupported certificate purpose
  new-docs: |
    The certificate's key is being used for a different purpose than allowed.
    
    #### Explanation
    
    Certificates can be used for various purposes. It might be desirable to use a certificate only for specific purposes. This is achieved by the `keyUsage` extension, which defines nine possible usages of the certificate (e.g., `digitalSignature` or `dataEncipherment`). End entity certificates can also specify the extended key uses (in the `extKeyUsage` extension).
    
    #### Security perspective
    
    Using the certificate for the purpose forbidden in the certificate may pose a risk to your data or systems. (For example, the key's security may not be sufficient for the forbidden use).
    
    #### Next steps
    
    Check both the `keyUsage` and `extKeyUsage` to see if the listed purposes include the one for which you are attempting to use the certificate.

  weight: 302
  message: |
    path length constraint exceeded
  new-docs: |
    The allowed length of the certification path was exceeded.
    
    #### Explanation
    
    Certification Authorities (CAs) can mandate the maximal length of the trusted certificate chains below their certificate. This is done using the `pathLenConstraint` field in the `basicConstraints` extension. If the certificate chain created during validation is longer than this limit, the validation fails due to the violated path length constraint. This limit includes only intermediate certificates – the first (CA) and the last (endpoint) certificates are excluded.
    
    #### Security perspective
    
    An exceeded certificate path length signifies that one of the sub-authorities issued a certificate it was not allowed. Therefore, the CA or one of the sub-authorities may not be trustworthy.
    
    #### Next steps
    
    Inspect the certificate chain to find the `pathLenConstraint` in the `basicConstraints` extension that was violated. Inform the (sub-)authority issuing this certificate about the violation lower in the certificate chain.

    A critical extension was not recognized or could not be processed.
    
    #### Explanation
    
    Certificate extensions can be used for extending certificates with additional information. Each extension is either marked as critical or non-critical (in the `critical` field in the extension). If an extension is marked as critical, it must be processed. If the processing system cannot recognize or process a critical extension, it must reject the certificate.
    
    #### Security perspective
    
    Marking an extension as critical is a way for the certificate issuer to denote it is _absolutely essential_ to process and understand it. If it is not processed, we may lack the necessary information and misuse the certificate. We may, for example, miss the intended purpose or key usage constraint. Inappropriateong usage circumvents the guarantees of the certificate authority, possibly putting our systems at risk.
    
    #### Next steps
    Inspect the certificate extensions marked with `critical: true` to find the offender. Make sure that only the necessary extensions are marked as critical. Marking non-standard extensions as critical may cause problems in the general context.
