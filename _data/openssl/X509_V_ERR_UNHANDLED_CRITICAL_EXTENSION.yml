new-docs-oneliner: |
  Either critical extension was not recognized, or information in critical extension could not be processed.
new-docs-explanation: |
  Certificate extensions can be used for incorporating additional information into a certificate. The extensions can be critical or non-critical (determined by <i>critical</i> field for every extension in the certificate). All extensions marked as critical must be processed. If a system, which processes a certificate, cannot recognize a critical extension, it must reject the certificate. The certificate has to be rejected also when the system is unable to process the information contained in the critical extension.
new-docs-security-perspective: |
  An extension can carry arbitrary information, and marking it as critical means that it is crucial to process it. If it cannot be processed, there is a security risk that a certificate’s key will be used in a manner it must not be, e.g., that a certificate’s key will be used for another purpose that it was aimed or that a Certification Authority will issue a certificate for subject name for which it is not allowed to issue certificates, or many other security risks.
new-docs-consequences: |
  If you ignore critical extensions that cannot be processed, it may result in unauthorized use of the certificate.
new-docs-what-to-do: |
  Make sure that only necessary extensions are marked as critical and that the values of critical extensions are meaningful. It is recommended to use standard extensions (specified in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1">RFC 5280</a>). Marking non-standard extensions as critical may cause problems in the general context.
