new-docs-oneliner: |
  Validity of the certificate has expired.
new-docs-explanation: |
  Every certificate is delivered for a certain time period (determined by <i>notBefore</i> and <i>notAfter</i> fields in certificate). The time period determines the validity of certificate. When time period elapses, the certificate becomes expired.
new-docs-security-perspective: |
  The certificate is not valid anymore which means that issuing Certification Authority (CA) does not maintain information about the certificate and does not guarantee the correctness of information provided in the certificate. Moreover, expired certificates are removed from Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) which means that a certificate might be revoked in the past (e.g. because of revealed private key), but we do not get this information about expired certificate.
new-docs-consequences: |
  Ensure that date, time and time zone are set correctly on your device. If the time settings are correct, you should get new valid certificate from the CA. In this case, contact either the CA which issued the previous certificate or another CA.
new-docs-what-to-do: |
  The expired certificate is untrustworthy, which may harm your business. If you decide to trust to it, you may communicate with another person/entity than you think which may lead to theft of personal information.
