  The provided certificate is self-signed and it cannot be found in the list of trusted certificates.

  #### Explanation

  The provided certificate (at zero depth) is self-signed (`issuer` and `subject` fields are the same). Self-signed certificates serve as certification authorities, which need to be explicitly trusted. However, this certificate is not in the list of trusted certificates.

  #### Security perspective

  The certificate could be issued by anyone so the information contained in the certificate is not reliable (there can be written almost anything, so it may look like a certificate of a well-known company while it is certificate of a fraud).

  #### Consequences

  If you trust the certificate without verifying the issuer, you may trust the certificates, which do not contain trustworthy information.

  #### Next steps

  Use self-signed certificates only for test purposes. Otherwise, let your certificate to be signed by a recognized certification authority.
